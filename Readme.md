Spectrum News

Background
As the upheaval in the recent years has shown, the polarisation we see in the present day has been fuelled by misinformation and one sided reportage. And itâ€™s hard to venture out of our cozy silos when the world outside can seem increasingly unhinged. By displaying a spread of news across the full political spectrum, this app invites users to broaden their minds.

The concept is intentionally narrow. At first I wanted to create a full news website complete with user logins and comment sections. However, after thinking about the kind of user that would need this app, as elaborated below, I whittled down the features to just one core functionality: to display a range of perspectives on a given topic.

The ultimate goal is for the user to be able to select trending hashtags and to see a dashboard of perspectives on the selected topic. The current version of the app only displays news by top headlines. This is what is feasible with my current skills in React. I am working on building up my skills in React so I can bring the full vision to life.

User Stories:
The ideal user for this app is curious and open minded. They already access their news through other sources so they are not looking for a full news website. What they are looking for instead is a simple news aggregator offers multiple points of view without the conflict and chaos that is prominent on forums such as Reddit or Twitter.

Installation instructions for dependencies:
After cloning the repository, run "npm install" on iterm.

Challenges:

1. Transporting data over from the form to the API has been a challenge. I am working on resolving the issue.
2. Slow load speed. Unfortunately, there is a lag in the app when loading news items. I suspect this is due to the API that I am using. I will explore other API's as speed is crucial for a news app, especially one that does not offer much functionality other than browsing.
3. Styling has been a challenge. I was not able to change the colour of the font in the input field. So I have had to change the background colour from black to grey, which has made the app less attractive.
