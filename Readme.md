Spectrum News

Background
As the upheaval in the recent years has shown, the polarisation we see in the present day has been fuelled by misinformation and one sided reportage. And itâ€™s hard to venture out of our cozy silos when the world outside can seem increasingly unhinged. By displaying a spread of news across the full political spectrum, this app invites users to broaden their minds.

Tech Specs:
The app is front end only. I have used ReactJS along with UI components from Material UI.

User Stories:

Challenges:
Making multiple API calls using the same API. I had to get creative with using useState, and this is probably the first time that the concept has sunk in
The other challenge was Material UI, in my previous versions of the app, the cards were arranged horizontally but I changed something and that arrangement has fallen apart.

Future Additions:
The idea is for people to be able to search for trending hashtags and be able to see a dashboard of perspectives on that topic. I will add that feature to my app to get it portfolio ready.
